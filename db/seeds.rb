# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# User, ChildTrip, Child, RoleUser, Role, Trip
# consider another way to create an admin user
# Create Users
# Create Roles for Users
# Create Kids
# Create Trips
# Add Kids to a Trip
# probably add the kids and create the trips last thing
